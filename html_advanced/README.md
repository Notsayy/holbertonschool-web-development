# HTML Advanced

## Description

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. The goal is to build a complete HTML structure of a web page based on a Figma design. No CSS or JavaScript is required at this stage. The focus is on using semantic HTML elements correctly.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, I should be able to explain:

-   What HTML is
-   What a markup language is
-   What the DOM is
-   What an HTML element and tag are
-   What an attribute is
-   The purpose of each HTML tag
-   How to build a web page from a wireframe

## Design

The layout and structure must follow the provided Figma file. A Figma account is required to duplicate the design and view specifications.
